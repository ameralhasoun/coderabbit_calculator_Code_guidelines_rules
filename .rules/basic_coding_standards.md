## Basic Coding Standards

### ✅ Error Handling
Ensure methods handle possible errors or invalid inputs.  
- Success: Inputs are validated or wrapped in try-catch blocks.  
- Failure: Methods assume inputs are always valid or can cause exceptions.

### 🧱 Naming Conventions
Check that all class and method names follow C# PascalCase naming.  
- Success: Names use PascalCase (e.g., AddNumbers, Calculator).  
- Failure: Names use snake_case, camelCase, or inconsistent capitalization.

### 📝 Code Comments
Verify that important or public methods include a short descriptive comment.  
- Success: Public methods have clear summaries of their purpose.  
- Failure: Missing or unclear comments.

### 🖨️ Console Logging
Ensure console outputs are meaningful and descriptive.  
- Success: Console.WriteLine messages describe what is printed.  
- Failure: Vague or generic outputs.

### ✨ Clean and Readable Code
Confirm that code is clean, readable, and properly formatted.  
- Success: Consistent indentation, spacing, and simple structure.  
- Failure: Unclear logic, messy layout, or inconsistent formatting.

### ♻️ Code Duplication
Detect and report duplicated or repeated logic across classes, methods, or files.  
- Success: Shared logic is extracted into reusable methods or services.  
- Failure: Similar or identical code blocks appear in multiple places without reuse.
